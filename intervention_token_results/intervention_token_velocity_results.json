How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Answer (step-by-step): There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 + 200 = 440",

Plug in the given values: v = sqrt(2 * 3.466e+04 / 12). 4. Calculate the velocity: v = 24.4 m/s. 5. Use the formula for distance: d = v * t. 6. Rearrange the formula to solve for time: t = d / v. 7. Plug in the given values: t = 40 / 24.4. 8. Calculate the time: t = 1.64 s. So the answer is 1.64. Question",

Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 +",

First, we need to find the velocity of the car using the kinetic energy formula: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2. 2. Rearrange the formula to solve for velocity: v = sqrt(2 * KE / m). 3. Plug in the given values: v = sqrt(2 * 5.511e+04 / 16). 4. Calculate the velocity: v = 26.4 m/s. 5. Now, we can use the formula for displacement: d = v * t. 6. Rearrange the formula to solve for time: t = d / v. 7. Plug in the given values: t = 91 / 26.4. 8. Calculate the time: t = 3.45 s.<|endoftext|>",

    "final_text": "Question: Consider a 16 kg runner with 2.691e+04 Joules of kinetic energy. Find the number of seconds needed to move 67 meters. Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: First, we need to find the velocity of the runner. We can do this using the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity. We can rearrange the formula to solve for velocity: v = sqrt(2 * KE / m). Plugging in the given values, we get: v = sqrt(2 * 2.691e+04 / 16) = 58.63 m/s. Now that we have the velocity, we can find the time it takes to move 67 meters using the formula: time = distance / velocity. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 67 / 58.63 = 1.14 seconds.

Question: A 1000 car parking lot is divided into 3 sections. There are 320 spaces in section 1, and 200 more in section 2 than in section 3. How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Answer (step-by-step): There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces",

Question: A 1000 car parking lot is divided into 3 sections. There are 320 spaces in section 1, and 200 more in section 2 than in section 3. How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Answer (step-by-step): There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 + 200 = 440. The answer is 440. Question: A store owner buys clothes",

There are 320 spaces in section 1, and 200 more in section 2 than in section 3. How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Answer (step-by-step): There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 + 200 = 440. So the answer is 440.

Question: A 1000 car parking lot is divided into 3 sections. There are 320 spaces in section 1, and 200 more in section 2 than in section 3. How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Answer (step-by-step): There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480.

    "final_text": "Question: A 3 kg ball has 4.860e+02 Joules of kinetic energy. How long does it take to travel 59.5 meters? Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: First find the ball's velocity by plugging the given values into the equation for kinetic energy: 4.860e+02 J = 1 / 2 * 3 kg * (velocity) ^ 2. This simplifies to 324 N = 1.5 kg * (velocity) ^ 2. This simplifies to 216 m ^ 2 / s ^ 2 = (velocity) ^ 2. Taking the square root of both sides gives 14.7 m / s = velocity. Now that we know the velocity, we can use the equation velocity = distance / time to find the time, rearranging to get time = distance / velocity. Plugging in the given values, this is time = 59.5 m / 14.7 m / s = 4.04761904762 s. So the answer is 4.04761904762. Question: A store owner repacked his oils into 200 mL bottles.

There are 320 spaces in section 1, and 200 more in section 2 than in section 3. How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Answer (step-by-step): There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 +",
